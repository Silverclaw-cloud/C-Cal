# C-Cal
This is a cal written in c++.
I've created this just for fun. (dots will confuse it)
to use on linux, download the file, move it to your home dir, then open the terminal and type: g++ cal.cpp -o ./some-name-you-want-to-give-it.

for macos, download dev tools, then, double click the .cpp file, then it will run in the terminal.
